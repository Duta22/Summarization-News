# Summarization News
 
In the Summarization project using news from CNN, the initial step taken is to perform data retrieval or scraping on a website using the Newspaper3k library. After the scraping process, we obtain information such as the news title, news author, publication date, and news summary. The next step is to create a dataframe using the Pandas library. Then, we prepare unstructured data to become well-structured and ready for processing. The preprocessing steps include processes such as case folding, parsing, stop words removal, stemming, converting the dataframe to a file, removing duplicate data, summarization processing, tokenization, and iteration.

Upon completing the data preprocessing stage, the frequency distribution of each word appearing in the news text will be observed. The frequency distribution will be graphically presented. From the results of the frequency distribution of each word, an evaluation of sentence score or the process of associating numerical values with sentences based on the priority of algorithm usage will be conducted. The final step involves visualizing frequently and infrequently occurring words according to the processed frequency distribution using a word cloud to observe patterns and trends within the text.
